    <p class="p">Hello! My name is Harishitha and I am a high school junior. I grew up in India, but lived about half of life in America. One of the things that has been with me throughout my life is art.  I love experimenting with different types of art such as macamre, crochet, crafting, origami, digital media and video editing.  Check out the portfolio page to see more of the projects I have worked on since childhood.
